## 🛠️ How It Works

### What You Do:
1. Drop photos into folders
2. Edit a simple JSON file with section names
3. Run `npm run build`

### What Happens Automatically:
- ✅ **Files renamed** if they start with underscore (GitHub Pages compatibility)
- ✅ **Thumbnails** generated (400px wide for grid view)
- ✅ **Web versions** generated (2560px max for lightbox - protects originals!)
- ✅ **EXIF metadata** extracted (camera, lens, settings, date)
- ✅ **Image dimensions** calculated
- ✅ **Complete data file** created (`data/photos.json`)
- ✅ **Social preview image** updated in `index.html` (uses first photo from first section)

### What You See:
- Beautiful responsive gallery
- Lightbox with image metadata
- Organized sections
- Smooth animations

## 🛡️ Image Protection

Your original high-resolution files are **protected**:

- **Originals**: Stay on your machine only (excluded from Git)
- **Web versions**: 2560px max dimension for online viewing
- **Thumbnails**: 400px for grid display

Perfect for 32" monitors but not suitable for printing or detailed zooming. Your master files remain private!

## 📸 Metadata Support

Automatically extracts and displays (when available):
- Camera make and model
- Lens information
- Focal length
- Aperture (f-stop)
- Shutter speed
- ISO sensitivity
- Date taken

**Missing metadata?** No problem - fields are only shown if they exist in your photo's EXIF data.

## 💡 Tips

- **Keep originals** - Don't delete source images after building
- **Use descriptive folder names** - They help organize your collections
- **Test locally first** - Always preview with `npm run serve` before deploying
- **Commit thumbnails** - Include generated thumbnails in Git to keep originals private
