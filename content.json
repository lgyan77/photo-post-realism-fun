      "My journey in photography began as a teenager, inspired by the photography magazines my father collected. In the final years of pre-digital photography, I joined a local club and was fortunate to have a few prints accepted at FIAP exhibitions—though never as a prize winner. Today, I find creative fulfilment (and fun!) in using post-processing to stretch and augment reality in landscape images to evoke impressions, rather than to document reality.",
